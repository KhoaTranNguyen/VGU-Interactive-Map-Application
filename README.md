# VGU-Interactive-Map-Application
- This project is held by a group of five Computer Science and Engineering students from Vietnamese-German University for the course Multi-disciplinary Project.
- It is a simple, custom map based on the real new campus of VGU. The map also provides a clear visualization that shows each building, its name, as well as your current location, making it easier and more funny to explore the real campus.
