# VGU-Interactive-Map-Application
- This project is a simple, custom map based on the real new campus of VGU. The map also provides a clear visualization that shows each building, its name, as well as your current location, making it easier and more funny to explore the real campus.
- We chose to use Flask as our framework, along with the Google Maps and Geolocation APIs, to receive and display users' GPS data from their devices. Our project also incorporates a range of other technologies, including Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, etc.
